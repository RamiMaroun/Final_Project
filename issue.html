                <h2>The causes of violence against women</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many various factors for violence against women. Poverty increases violence against women,
                        as both poverty and unemployment can be considered among the most common economic causes of violence.
                        Women and girls who live in poor living conditions are exposed to multiple forms of discrimination
                        and thus may face increased risks of violence. They live in poverty, they are more vulnerable to
                        exploitation, and they are forced into early marriage with a greater proportion of girls who live
                        in richer levels. Married women suffer from partner violence, but they are forced to stay with him
                        and not end that violent relationship because of their lack of income, and to obtain financial
                        support, they stay with them because there is not enough money for them to find shelter or to buy food.
                        Their income is often controlled by their partner in the event of living in those violent relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negative social norms are among the most powerful factors that lead to inequality between men and
                        women, and they also contribute to increasing the risk of violence against women.
                        Among these criteria are the acceptance of patriarchal concepts related to male dominance
                        and granting them the right to control the behavior of women and resorting to violence as a
                        means of conflict resolution and acceptance in the society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The woman herself can be one of the main factors that lead to violence against her, and that is
                        when she is very afraid of the man himself or of the society in which she lives so that she is
                        forced to remain silent about the violence practiced against her and to submit to it in the
                        absence of any person to resort to protect her when exposed to any Some form of violence,
                        in addition to the fear of most women to resort to the courts and file complaints due to their
                        conviction that there are no deterrent laws on violence, in addition to the family pressure that
                        women may be exposed to if they file a complaint against the man, and sometimes the husband may
                        force her to waive all of her rights, whether legal or Legitimacy, these matters have taken
                        together do not encourage women to resort to the courts to ward off violence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Statsâ€™ laws, policies, and practices may have a direct role in violence against women by creating an
                        environment that permits, tolerates, and justifies violence. In addition to the absence of any
                        penalties for those who commit violence against women, or the ease of impunity, if any.
