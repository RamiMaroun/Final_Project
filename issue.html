                    <h2>Violence against women</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to the UN, women experience physical violence, but also suppression, lack of equality,
                        and human rights (UN 2020). Violence against women is any violent behavior practiced against her
                        , which is based on intolerance of sex and leads to harm to her on the physical, psychological,
                        and sexual aspects. Violence against women is a clear and explicit violation of human rights it
                        prevents them from enjoying their full rights. It should be noted that the consequences of
                        violence not only affect women but also affect the family and society as a whole, due to the
                        negative social, economic, health, and other effects it has. Violence against women is not
                        limited to one form but takes several forms including:

                <h2>The causes of violence against women</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many factors for violence against women. Poverty increases violence against women.
                        As both poverty and unemployment can be considered among the most common economic causes of
                        violence. Women and girls who live under poor living conditions are exposed to multiple forms
                        of discrimination and thus may face increased risks of violence. They live in poverty, they are
                        more vulnerable to exploitation, and they are forced into early marriage than a greater
                        proportion of girls who live in richer levels.
                        Married women suffer from partner violence, but they are forced to stay with them and not end
                        that violent relationship because there is not enough money for them to find shelter or to buy
                        food. Their income is often controlled by their partner in the event of living in those violent
                        relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negative social norms are among the most powerful factors that lead to inequality between
                        men and women. As well as and they also contribute to increasing the risk of violence against
                        women. Among these criteria are the acceptance of patriarchal concepts related to male dominance
                        and granting them the right to control the behavior of women and resorting to violence as a
                        means of conflict resolution and acceptance in the society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The woman herself can be one of the main factors that lead to violence against her, and
                        that is when she is very afraid of the man himself or of the society in which she lives.
                        She is thus she is forced to remain silent about the violence practiced against her and to
                        submit to it in the absence of any person to resort to protect her when exposed to any or
                        some form of violence. In addition to the reluctance of most women to resort to the courts
                        and file complaints due to their conviction that there are no deterrent laws on violence.
                        In addition to the family pressure that women may be exposed to if they file a complaint
                        against the man. Sometimes the husband may force her to waive all of her rights, whether
                        legal or Legitimacy. These matters have taken together do not encourage women to resort to
                        the courts to ward off violence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Statsâ€™ laws, policies, and practices may have a direct role in violence against women by
                        creating an environment that permits, tolerates, and justifies violence. In addition to the
                        absence of any penalties for those who commit violence against women, or the ease of
                        impunity, if any.
