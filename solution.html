                <h2><span class="color">combating</span> violence against women</h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is based on the principle of combating violence against women, by creating a website and mobile
                    application, through which it publishes personal experiences of women's victims of violence, in which
                    the user chooses to publish anonymously or not,  with a hashtag to support the case, and to provide
                    advice to other people on how to act in such cases. The user can receive replays from other users as
                    well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the system, psychologists, legal, or health professionals, in general, can provide
                    guidance and support through their own control panel through which they can answer users' inquiries.
                    Registration of specialists in the system is not done randomly, as those interested (volunteers)
                    must send to the site management certificates or documents that prove their competence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app combating VAW contributes to estimating the cases and causes of violence against women
                    around the world.
                    Many violence cases against women are unreported because of many reasons. Shame, fear and lack of
                    knowledge about rights make women reluctant to report incidents to the police.
                    The app can help us to gather information about VAW in these countries where women exposed to
                    various violence without reporting.
